###Objectives:

-	To create a project that applies the lesson learned in DATASAL
-	To create an application that can interest and entertain people while experience and learn from the game
-	To be able to apply a unique concept that is unfamiliar or underated to today’s games
-	To be able to construct the best data structure that will fit into the program


###Introduction:
Afterstory is an Sidescrolling RPG game inspired by many existing ones, such as Undertale, Child of Light, Earthbound, Grandia, to name a few, that includes a storyline and two protagonists, a brother and a sister. Each protagonist has different background, abilities, and morals that may gradually change throughout the game. One character is a Pacifist and the other one has a Genocide route. The player will have to choose only one character that they will play for the rest of the game.

Both have different actions and decisions throughout the game and both have different ways on fighting the enemy. The endings of this game have at least 6 to 8 results, both good and bad route. Game is heavily story implemented and will be used as one of its progress. The cut scenes will be in-game and rarely cinematic, but this will have an impact to story and decision making later on.

The movements and interactions on this game will be based on side scroll, where the character will move either to the left and right and interact with another character either by mouse or keyboard. Every player will have different experiences on what main character and interaction they choose.

The player will have access to the inventory of the character like in all other RPG games. Should the player choose either of the characters, their items and equipment would be very different from one another and will have different attributes and stats if possible.

The battle system, on the other hand will be quite unique unlike in other RPG games where mostly it’s just a basic turn base actions with options on the screen. In this game, a puzzle board and a timer will be used as an interface to deal with the encounters, and each character will have a different action based on the color of the matching objects.

Lastly, the “Save” and the menu options would be implanted either in-game screen when pressed by a specific keyboard action or placed at the side of the screen where the player can access anytime. Different options can be laid out as well and if possible, it should be easy friendly to the player.
